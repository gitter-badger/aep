# AEP Image Generator

This is a pretty simple little script. It doesn't do much which is why I
like it. It is a clone of davethemoonman's image of aep score developed
by
[C26000](http://www.last.fm/group/We%2BDon%2527t%2BHave%2BExponential%2BProfiles/journal/2006/05/4/129052).

## Installation

1. Go to [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/api) and register yourself a new
API key.
2. Copy the example config file to `config.php` and replace with your
API key.
3. Drop both `config.php` and `index.php` into your PHP ready server. 
4. Test at
[http://yourserver/path/index.php?u=yourLastFMUserName](http://yourserver/path/index.php?u=yourLastFMUserName).
